		<p><strong>I Saw A Tree By The Riverside Sheet Music</strong>. Poem by Joyce Kilmer. How do you grow so straight and tall I said to my wintertime tree. I saw one hanging on a tree In agony and blood Who fixed His loving eyes on me As near His cross I stood And never till my dying breath Will I forget that look It seemed to charge me with His death Though not a word He spoke. Ive got leaves growing up to the sunshine.</p>
